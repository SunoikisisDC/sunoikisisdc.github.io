# SunoikisisDC
An International Consortium of Digital Classics Programs

Website: [https://sunoikisisdc.github.io](https://sunoikisisdc.github.io)

SunoikisisDC is an international consortium of Digital Classics programs originally developed by the [Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/) in collaboration with the Harvard’s [Center for Hellenic Studies](http://chs.harvard.edu/) and the [Institute of Classical Studies London](https://ics.sas.ac.uk/).

The program started in 2015 and the original goal was to extend the Sunoikisis program of the Center for Hellenic Studies to a global audience and contribute to it with a teaching program focused on the application of digital technologies to the study of Greek and Latin. Since then SunoikisisDC has grown up and is now an independent program, whose aim is to offer collaborative courses that foster interdisciplinary paradigms of learning. Master students of both the humanities and computer science are welcome to join the courses and work together by contributing to digital classics projects in a collaborative environment.

SunoikisisDC started in the SS 2015 with a Digital Classics course involving 12 countries. Faculty members of participating institutions gathered at the University of Leipzig in 2015, 2016, and 2017 for planning seminars in order to discuss course topics, schedule the academic calendar, and create the course syllabi. In the Fall 2016 we started a new track of SunoikisisDC based at the Institute of Classical Studies in London.

We currently have a community of instructors and students from more than 90 institutions from all around the world mapped on our [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1xTwH_U4aowfj58vF359nKmHzBs39Ljuh).

We are also working on a [Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4303839/sunoikisisdc) to collect all our bibliographic resources.

Our program is constantly evolving and growing. Stay tuned!
