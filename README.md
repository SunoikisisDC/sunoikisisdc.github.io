# SunoikisisDC
An International Consortium of Digital Classics Programs

Website: [https://sunoikisisdc.github.io](https://sunoikisisdc.github.io)

SunoikisisDC is an international consortium of Digital Classics programs originally developed by the [Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/) in collaboration with the Harvard’s [Center for Hellenic Studies](http://chs.harvard.edu/) and the [Institute of Classical Studies, London](https://ics.sas.ac.uk/).

The program started in 2015 and the original goal was to extend the Sunoikisis program of the Center for Hellenic Studies to a global audience and contribute to it with a teaching program focused on the application of digital technologies to the study of Greek and Latin. Since then SunoikisisDC has grown up and is now an independent program, whose aim is to offer collaborative courses that foster interdisciplinary paradigms of learning. Master students of both the humanities and computer science are welcome to join the courses and work together by contributing to digital classics projects in a collaborative environment.

SunoikisisDC started in the SS 2015 with a Digital Classics course involving 12 countries. Faculty members of participating institutions gathered at the University of Leipzig in 2015, 2016, and 2017 for planning seminars in order to discuss course topics, schedule the academic calendar, and create the course syllabi. In the Fall 2016 we started a new track of SunoikisisDC based at the Institute of Classical Studies in London.

We currently have a community of instructors and students from more than 90 institutions from all around the world mapped on our [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1xTwH_U4aowfj58vF359nKmHzBs39Ljuh).

Thanks to the generous support of the [Digitale Lehre](https://www.zls.uni-leipzig.de/newsdetail/artikel/projektfoerderung-digitale-lehre-innovativ-und-vernetzt-2022-10-10) initiative at Leipzig University in WS 2022/23, we have now two new resources:
* [Zotero Group Library SunoikisisDC](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4303839/sunoikisisdc). A collection of bibliographic and digital resources from our SunoikisisDC sessions. The library has been created by Aron Teuscher at Leipzig University, who has also written [Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxndqMu7vZ3uMV27FljP8Lq3bffvaWAO72bEKlp35As/edit?usp=sharing) for anyone who is interested in adding new entries. We kindly ask you all to follow these guidelines :)
* [SunoikisisDC Sessions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAYHnhMEFfR0npgrYDjm6_AmLzmqDZFPhEHzJcAGQB8/edit?usp=sharing). A Google Spreadsheet with all the sessions of our program since its beginning. This resource has been created by Susanne Heydecke at Leizig University and can be consulted to look for a specific session, topic, or convenor.

Our program is constantly evolving and growing. Stay tuned!
