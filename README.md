SunoikisisDC is an international consortium of Digital Classics programs developed by the [Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/) in collaboration with the Harvard’s [Center for Hellenic Studies](http://chs.harvard.edu/) and the [Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/).

The goal is to extend [Sunoikisis CHS](http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/sunoikisis/) to a global audience and contribute to it with a teaching program focused on the application of digital technologies to the study of Greek and Latin. The aim is to offer collaborative courses that foster interdisciplinary paradigms of learning. Master students of both the humanities and computer science are welcome to join the courses and work together by contributing to digital classics projects in a collaborative environment.

SunoikisisDC started in the SS 2015 with a Digital Classics course involving 12 countries. Faculty members of participating institutions gathered at the University of Leipzig on February 16-18, 2015 for a planning seminar in order to discuss course topics, schedule the academic calendar, and create the course syllabus.
The SunoikisisDC 2016 and SunoikisisDC 2017 planning seminars were held at the University of Leipzig on December 16-17, 2015 and on December 12-13, 2016. In the Fall 2016 we started a new track of SunoikisisDC based at the Institute of Classical Studies in London. We currently have a community of instructors and students from more than 15 countries involving more than 30 institutions. Stay tuned!

The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has granted us support for a SunoikisisDC two-weeks intensive Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities, that will be held at Tufts University in Summer 2018: [*Digital Editions, Digital Corpora and new possibilities for the Humanities in the Academy and Beyond*. A NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities – Perseus Project, Tufst University, July 16-27, 2018](https://sites.tufts.edu/digitaleditions/).
